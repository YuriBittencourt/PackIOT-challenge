## The challenge is as follows:
Considering Python 3.6 or newer, create a Github repository to solve with Python the
following challenge: given that you cannot use any mathematical operation different from
SUM, create a program that solves the Exponentiation for entries x and y. Consider that
you are working with a very simple programming language and you cannot use any
python library or function. The user will be prompted to enter non-negative values for x
and y and the script will return x<sup>y</sup>
